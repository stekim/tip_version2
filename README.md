# Pre-work - tip_version2

tip_calculator 2 is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Steve Kim

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total. It was a lot faster the second time around.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesnt have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
Added a tip splitter for parties up to 4
The settings menu is a custom entry tip field, so you can choose how much tip exactly you feel like giving.

## Notes

I didn't implement the revealviewcontroller file, as I was facing bugs that were not clearly debuggable. I think they came as a result of mixing objective C and swift.
